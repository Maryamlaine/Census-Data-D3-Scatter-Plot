          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age and Income for Census Behavioral Risk Data</h2>
          <p> Correlation coefficients between two variables shows the extent to which change in the value of one variable 
            is correlated to change in the value of the other. The sign of the correlation coefficient shows the direction
            of the correlation(+ or -). The correlation coefficient between lack of healthcare and poverty was 
            .52. Poverty is both cause and a consequence of poor health. It is important to look at R-squared which was .27 meaning
            that 27% of the difference between poverty and healthcare is predictable by the correlation. Based on Census data, 
          Texas has the highest rate of no healthcare coverage (~25%) and MA has the lowest rate of no healthcare coverage (4.6%).</p>

          <p> Age and poverty have a negative correlation of -.10 which shows a very weak relationship between age and poverty level.
            Smoking rate were lowest in State of Utah (9.7%) and highest in Kentucky(26.2%) and West Virginia(26.7%).
            The median age of smokers ranged from 30 in Utah to 38 in Kentucky and 41 in West Virginia.
          </p>

          <p> Income and poverty had a strong and reverse correlation coefficient of -.75 and with the R-squared of 58%.
            Maryland has the highest median household income of $73,000 versus West Virginia with $41000.
            you can also look at obesity rate within united States. The correlation coefficient between obesity and poverty was .46 with
            R-squared of 21%. Colorado has the lowest rate of obesity (21.3%) and Arkansas and West Virginia have the 
            highest obesity rates of 35.9% and 35.7% respectively.
