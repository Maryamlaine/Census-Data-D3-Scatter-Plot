# Census Data Scatter Plot

 We used Census data to draw scatter plots for health risks such as lack of health care, smoking and obesity facing demographics. The plot is interactive, and you can pick different x or y axis and get a scatter plot for all states within United States. Tool-tips also designed to show the data for each state.
